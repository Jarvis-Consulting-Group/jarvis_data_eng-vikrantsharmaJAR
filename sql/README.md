# Introduction

In this project, PostgresQL is used to evaluate data relevant to a recently established country club. The schema includes details on the members, as well as information on bookings for amenities like tennis courts. The database is made to allow club management to create queries so they may examine facility utilisation and demand and decide how efficiently to operate the facility. The database schema consisted of mainly 3 tables Members(cd.members), Bookings (cd.bookings) and facilities(cd.facilities). 



# Table Setup (DDL)

```
sql
CREATE TABLE cd.members
(
    memid                    INTEGER NOT NULL,
    surname                  VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    firstname                VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    address                  VARCHAR(300) NOT NULL,
    zipcode                  INTEGER NOT NULL,
    telephone                VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    recommendedby            INTEGER,
    joindate                 TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT members_pk PRIMARY KEY (memid),
    CONSTRAINT fk_members_recommendedby FOREIGN KEY (recommendedby)
        REFERENCES cd.members(memid) ON DELETE SET NULL
);


CREATE TABLE cd.facilities
(
    facid                     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    name                      VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,

    facid                     INTEGER NOT NULL,
    memid                     INTEGER NOT NULL,

# Here is the list of SQL queries that we executed on this database

## Modifying Data

###### Question 1
The club is adding a new facility - a spa. We need to add it into the facilities table. Use the following values: facid: 9, Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.

```sql
INSERT INTO cd.facilities (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)
       VALUES (9, 'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);
```
###### Question 2
Let's try adding the spa to the facilities table again. This time, though, we want to automatically generate the value for the next facid, rather than specifying it as a constant. Use the following values for everything else: Name: 'Spa', membercost: 20, guestcost: 30, initialoutlay: 100000, monthlymaintenance: 800.

```sql
INSERT INTO cd.facilities (facid, name, membercost, guestcost, initialoutlay, monthlymaintenance)
       VALUES ((SELECT max(facid)+1 FROM cd.facilities),'Spa', 20, 30, 100000, 800);
```

###### Question 3
Let`s assume that We made a mistake when entering the data for the second tennis court. The initial outlay was 10000 rather than 8000: you need to alter the data to fix the error.

```sql
UPDATE cd.facilities
SET initialoutlay=10000
    WHERE name='Tennis Court 2';
```

###### Question 4
Here we want to alter the price of the second tennis court so that it costs 10% more than the first one. Try to do this without using constant values for the prices, so that we can reuse the statement if we want to.

```sql
UPDATE cd.facilities
SET membercost = membercost * 1.1, guestcost = guestcost * 1.1
    WHERE facid = 1;
```

###### Question 5
As part of a clearout of our database, we want to delete all bookings from the cd.bookings table. How can we accomplish this?

```sql
DELETE FROM cd.bookings;
```  

###### Question 6
We want to remove member 37, who has never made a booking, from our database. How can we achieve that?

```sql
DELETE FROM  cd.members
       WHERE memid = 37;
``` 
## Basics

###### Question 7
How can you produce a list of facilities that charge a fee to members, and that fee is less than 1/50th of the monthly maintenance cost? Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the facilities in question.

```sql
SELECT facid, name, membercost, monthlymaintenance
       FROM cd.facilities
       WHERE membercost > 0 AND membercost < monthlymaintenance/50;
``` 

###### Question 8
How can you produce a list of all facilities with the word 'Tennis' in their name?

```sql
SELECT * FROM cd.facilities
	 WHERE name LIKE '%Tennis%';
```

###### Question 9
How can you retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5? Try to do it without using the OR operator.

```sql
SELECT * FROM cd.facilities
	 WHERE facid IN (1,5);
``` 

###### Question 10
How can you produce a list of members who joined after the start of September 2012? Return the memid, surname, firstname, and joindate of the members in question.

```sql
SELECT memid, surname, firstname, joindate FROM cd.members
       WHERE joindate >= '2012-09-01';
``` 

###### Question 11
You, for some reason, want a combined list of all surnames and all facility names. Yes, this is a contrived example :-). Produce that list!

```sql
SELECT surname FROM cd.members
UNION
SELECT name FROM cd.facilities;
``` 

## Join

###### Question 12
How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings by members named 'David Farrell'?

```sql
SELECT starttime FROM cd.bookings A
       JOIN cd.members B
       ON A.memid = B.memid
       WHERE firstname LIKE 'David' AND surname LIKE 'Farrell';
``` 

###### Question 13
How can you produce a list of the start times for bookings for tennis courts, for the date '2012-09-21'? Return a list of start time and facility name pairings, ordered by the time.

```sql
SELECT a.starttime, b.name FROM cd.bookings A
       JOIN cd.facilities B
       ON a.facid = b.facid
       WHERE b.name LIKE 'Tennis %' AND a.starttime >= '2012-09-21' AND a.starttime < '2012-09-22'
       ORDER BY a.starttime;
``` 

###### Question 14
How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any)? Ensure that results are ordered by (surname, firstname).

```sql
SELECT a.firstname AS memfname, a.surname AS memsname, b.firstname AS recfname, b.surname AS recsname 
       FROM cd.members a
       LEFT JOIN cd.members b
       ON a.recommendedby = b.memid
       ORDER BY memsname, memfname;
``` 

###### Question 15
How can you output a list of all members who have recommended another member? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that results are ordered by (surname, firstname).

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT a.firstname as firstname, a.surname AS surname FROM cd.members b
	        INNER JOIN cd.members a
                ON b.recommendedby = a.memid
                ORDER BY surname, firstname;
``` 

###### Question 16
How can you output a list of all members, including the individual who recommended them (if any), without using any joins? Ensure that there are no duplicates in the list, and that each firstname + surname pairing is formatted as a column and ordered.

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT concat(firstname, ' ',surname) as member,
                (SELECT concat(firstname, ' ',surname) AS recommender FROM cd.members a WHERE b.recommendedby = a.memid)
	        FROM cd.members b;
``` 

## Aggregation

###### Question 17
Produce a count of the number of recommendations each member has made. Order by member ID.

```sql
SELECT recommendedby, count(*) FROM cd.members
       WHERE recommendedby IS NOT NULL
       GROUP BY recommendedby
       ORDER BY recommendedby;
``` 

###### Question 18
Produce a list of the total number of slots booked per facility. For now, just produce an output table consisting of facility id and slots, sorted by facility id.

```sql
SELECT facid, sum(slots) AS "Total Slots"
       FROM cd.bookings
       GROUP BY facid
       ORDER BY facid;
```

###### Question 19
Produce a list of the total number of slots booked per facility in the month of September 2012. Produce an output table consisting of facility id and slots, sorted by the number of slots.

```sql
SELECT facid, sum(slots) AS "Total Slots"
       FROM cd.bookings
       WHERE starttime >= '2012-09-01' and starttime < '2012-10-01'
       GROUP BY facid
       ORDER BY sum(slots);
```

###### Question 20
Produce a list of the total number of slots booked per facility per month in the year of 2012. Produce an output table consisting of facility id and slots, sorted by the id and month.

```sql
SELECT facid, extract(month from starttime) as month, sum(slots) AS "Total Slots"
       FROM cd.bookings
       WHERE extract(year from starttime) = 2012
       GROUP BY facid, month
       ORDER BY facid, month;
```

###### Question 21
Find the total number of members (including guests) who have made at least one booking.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT memid) FROM cd.bookings;
```

###### Question 22
Produce a list of each member name, id, and their first booking after September 1st 2012. Order by member ID. Hint: In a SQL query that uses the GROUP BY clause, all non-aggregated columns that appear in the SELECT clause must also appear in the GROUP BY clause. The purpose of the GROUP BY clause is to specify how the result set should be grouped based on one or more columns. Any columns that are not part of the grouping criteria must be included in an aggregate function in the SELECT clause.

```sql
SELECT a.surname, a.firstname, a.memid, min(b.starttime)
       FROM cd.members a JOIN cd.bookings b
       ON b.memid = a.memid
       WHERE starttime >= '2012-09-01'
       GROUP BY a.surname, a.firstname, a.memid
       ORDER BY memid;
```

###### Question 23
Produce a list of member names, with each row containing the total member count. Order by join date, and include guest members.

```sql
SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM cd.members) AS COUNT, firstname, surname
       FROM cd.members
       ORDER BY joindate;
```

###### Question 24
Produce a monotonically increasing numbered list of members (including guests), ordered by their date of joining. Remember that member IDs are not guaranteed to be sequential.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) over(order by joindate), firstname, surname
                FROM cd.members
                ORDER BY joindate;
```

###### Question 25
Output the facility id that has the highest number of slots booked. Ensure that in the event of a tie, all tieing results get output.

```sql
SELECT facid, total FROM (
       SELECT facid, sum(slots) total, dense_rank() over (order by sum(slots) desc) rank
       FROM cd.bookings
       GROUP by facid
       ) AS ranked
       WHERE rank = 1;
```

## String

###### Question 26
Output the names of all members, formatted as 'Surname, Firstname'

```sql
SELECT concat(surname, ', ', firstname) FROM cd.members;
```

###### Question 27
You've noticed that the club's member table has telephone numbers with very inconsistent formatting. You'd like to find all the telephone numbers that contain parentheses, returning the member ID and telephone number sorted by member ID.


```sql
SELECT memid, telephone FROM cd.members
       WHERE telephone ~ '[()]';
```

##### Question 28
You'd like to produce a count of how many members you have whose surname starts with each letter of the alphabet. Sort by the letter, and don't worry about printing out a letter if the count is 0.

```sql
SELECT substr (surname,1,1) AS letter, COUNT(*)
       FROM cd.members
       GROUP BY letter
       ORDER BY letter;
```
