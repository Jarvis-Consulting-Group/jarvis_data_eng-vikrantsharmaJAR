    description: In this project, Linux cluster Administration team developed a solution to monitor and manage the cluster of 10 servers/nodes. This application will allow the server users to retrieve and monitor the server`s hardware specifications as well as their usage information ( cpu, memory and disk usage related data) which will enable the LCA team to make informed decisions about the scalability(scale-up in case of high resource usage and scale down in case of low resource usage) of the servers and allocate the resources accordingly. This server information will streamline the operations hosted on those servers as well as maintenance of these servers. This application is using two bash scripts to retrieve hardware and usage information from the servers. The data collected by these scripts is being stored in the PostgreSQL database instance. We have used PostgreSQL(psql) as a database for higher scalability and security of the data. Following are the technologies used in this project,Git version control to track the development and deployment of the code, Docker Container as this project is developed inside a docker container to enable consistency across different IDE`s, Database PostgreSQL Apline version 9.6 to store data retrieved from server nodes.Psql Client tool to connect to the database and store the information about the servers into Psql. PostgresSQL instance client with Docker container acting as PostgresSQL server, Bash Scripting To generate two files host.info(to retrieve hardware specification) and host.usage(to retrieve Usage information.),Crontab as It schedules the script to run every minute to collect server`s usage data.This all-inclusive monitoring solution improves the stability and productivity of the server cluster, enabling smooth and uninterrupted operations.
